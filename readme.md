# Introduction:
This is our project for the mosaic ps1. The main file present will take care of all the test cases.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT, THE WORDS THAT WOULD BE GIVEN SHOULD BE JOINED BY A LINE WHICH MEANS THAT A
SINGLE WORD SHOULD BE IN TOUCH OF THE LINE, ANY WORD NOT IN TOUCH OF THE SHEROREKHA, WILL BE DISCARDED
BY THE MODEL. THIS IS THE ONLY REQUIREMENT FOR OUR MODEL TO RUN.

As for the main file you will find instructions stating where to paste the code for single word.

NOTE-> The problem statement says that we have to run code for only single word.(no matter the length)

FOR EXTRA POINTS->>>>>>>>>>>>>

	1> The SINGLE WORD image can be rotated upto 45 degrees only
	2> The SINGLE WORD image can be shadowed(upto a limit)
	3> The SINGLE WORD image can be blurred.

FOR EXTRA EXTRA POINTS->>>>>>>

   NOTE-> This is an experimental feature and can be used. It could give you acurate results for all words
          not only present in a line but also in a paragraph.


HAPPY TESTING !!!!!!!!!!
