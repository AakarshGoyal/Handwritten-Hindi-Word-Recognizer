# Hindi OCR || Mosaic'21 Round-1:
## Introduction:
This Project Hindi OCR(Optical Character Recognizer) will allow user to convert Hindi Handwritten Characters to Text form.
According to the Problem Statement, the OCR must recognize Single Words regardless of their Length. 
Image Correction and Letter Segmentation is performed using various OpenCv Techniques. 
While the Letter Recognition was performed using Deep Learning(DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) on 
the [Devnagri Hindi Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jhashanku007/devnagri-hindi-dataset "Hindi Dataset").



As for the main file you will find instructions stating where to paste the code for single word.

NOTE-> The problem statement says that we have to run code for only single word.(no matter the length)

FOR EXTRA POINTS->>>>>>>>>>>>>

	1> The SINGLE WORD image can be rotated upto 45 degrees only
	2> The SINGLE WORD image can be shadowed(upto a limit)
	3> The SINGLE WORD image can be blurred.
